# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.2] - 2020-05-27

### Added

* A new `Cache` class is now available to use for caching. You can set this in the `cache` option for a `Serializer` (use `true` if you want the built in cache).
* With caching, there is a ~586% speed improvement (412,768 ops/sec over the previous 70,435 ops/sec). Without-caching rates have stayed the same.

## [1.2.1] - 2020-05-27

### Added

* More keywords to `package.json` to help user search for this package.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-05-26

So, `ts-japi` has only been released a few days, but after some significant use in my APIs, I have realized a few things:

1. Linkers and certain classes should be allowed to parse `nullish` data (`nullish` meaning `undefined` or `null`).
2. The `relationships object` should be allowed to have custom keys, not dependent on the `relators` options
    * `Relator`s should always have a `Serializer`; otherwise, they wouldn't relate to any `resource` per se.
3. Projections should be "choose included" or "choose excluded" similar to MongoDB's.
4. The code can be faster.

With this in mind, here are the changes.

### Changed

* **[Breaking Change]** Every relator must define a `Serializer` as the second argument in its constructor (as opposed to the relator's options. Options can go in the third argument.
  * It may be subtle, but the reason for this lies in the fact `relationships object` must be keyed by the related object. If the relator has no serializer, then the relator has no related name, hence there is no canonical way to key the relationship.
  * We will now allow objects of relators to be defined as an option for `relators` on `Serializer`s. By using objects, the key for the relationship generated by the relator will correspond to the same key for that of the relator's.
* Several functional options now allow for `nullish` (`null` or `undefined`) arguments:
  * Resource Linkers can now type-safely use `nullish` arguments.
  * Resource Metaizers can now type-safely use `nullish` arguments.
* Several plain options now allow for `nullish` (`null` or `undefined`):
  * Serializer `projection` option has changed significantly (see the option itself) with `nullish` values.
* There is a ~33% speed improvement. (70,435 ops/sec over 52,843 ops/sec on a low-end Macbook Pro 15")

### Added

* Started a CHANGELOG to keep users updated.

#### Important Note

I want to say this IS unusual to have a breaking change without depreciation, but given the fact this package is only a few days old, I want to apologize if you are bothered by the above break. However, I will guarantee that API changes will go through depreciation before removal, so happy coding :)
